# Real-Time N-Body Integrator (C++ / OpenGL)

A small OpenGL demo that visualizes a simplified “solar-like” system in 3D using Newtonian gravity and a spacetime-style grid that deforms under the planets’ gravitational potential.

This is intentionally a **VISUALIZATION TOOL**, not an accurate numerical model of the real solar system. The value of constants have been chosen such that the program runs smoothly while still giving the viewer a general idea of what this system would look like. 

## Controls

- `W / A / S / D` – Move camera forward / left / back / right  
- `UP / DOWN` – Move camera up / down  
- `LEFT / RIGHT` – Yaw the camera  
- Mouse – Pitch / yaw the camera (when cursor is captured)  
- `ESC` – Quit
